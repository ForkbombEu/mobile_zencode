Given I have a 'string' named 'relying_party'

If I verify 'relying_party' has suffix '/'
When I split rightmost '1' bytes of 'relying_party'
EndIf

When I append the string '/.well-known/openid-relying-party' to 'relying_party'
and I rename 'relying_party' to 'rp_wk_endpoint'

Then print the 'rp_wk_endpoint'
