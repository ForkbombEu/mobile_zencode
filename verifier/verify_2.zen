Given I have a 'string array' in path 'result.jwks.keys'
Given I have a 'string' named 'alg'

Foreach 'jwk' in 'keys'
If I verify 'alg' is equal to 'alg' in 'jwk'
When I copy 'kid' from 'jwk' to 'kid'
and break the foreach
EndIf
EndForeach

If I verify 'kid' is not found
When I exit with error message 'Relying party key matching the jws header alg not found'
EndIf

When I set 'did_url' to 'https://did.dyne.org/dids/' as 'string'
and I append the 'kid' to 'did_url'

Then print the 'did_url'
